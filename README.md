# Iso7813

This is the full ISO-7813 implementation, in ruby! This is battle tested, production ready. Use at will.

I recommend that you copy those files into your own project and not use this as a gem.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'iso7813'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install iso7813

## Usage

Just include the modules into your classes.

## Help

Pretty please: don't ask me anything before reading the standard and the code. I'm either busy or drinking beer.
